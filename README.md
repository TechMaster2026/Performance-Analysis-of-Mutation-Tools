# Performance Analysis of Mutation Tools for Banking Application
### Project Overview
This project evaluates the performance of mutation testing tools, MutPy and Mutatest, in a banking application. The goal is to assess their effectiveness in injecting and detecting faults while analyzing their performance under load using Locust.

### Objectives
Compare MutPy and Mutatest for fault detection efficiency.\
Assess mutation testing impact on banking application robustness.\
Perform load testing using Locust to analyze execution time, stability, and resource utilization.

### Approach
**Mutation Testing**: Injects controlled faults using MutPy and Mutatest.\
**Test Execution**: Uses Pythonâ€™s unittest framework to evaluate detection rates.\
**Load Testing**: Simulates multiple users in Locust to measure performance impact.

### Technologies Used
**Mutation Testing**: MutPy, Mutatest\
**Performance Testing**: Locust\
**Programming Language**: Python\
**Testing Frameworks**: pytest, unittest

### How to Run
```
pip install mutpy
pip install mutatest
pip install locust
```

### Run mutation testing
- Using MutPy:
```
python "path/to/your/mut.py" --target BankApplication --unit-test test_BankApplication -m
```

- Using Mutatest:
```
mutatest --src "path/to/your/code" -s BankApplication.py -t "pytest"
```

### Start Locust for load testing:
```
locust -f locustfile.py -u 10 -r 2 --run-time 1m --csv=results  
```
### Conclusion
This study provides insights into selecting the optimal mutation testing tool for banking applications while ensuring high fault detection and efficient performance under stress.
